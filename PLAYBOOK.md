# Project 2: HTTP Server

# Benjamin Franklin

This project is written in <<Python>> on <<Windows 10>>.

## How to compile

The project is written in python so there is no need for a compiler

## How to run

1: download HTTPserver.py

2: open a terminal (tutorial will use windows command prompt)

3: cd into the directory that holds HTTPserver.py and run the following command: python HTTPserver.py

4: enter the desired port and directory as requested (3000 and ./www for example)

5: type localhost:port (3000) into the browser of your choice

## My experience with this project

This was a fun project to learn about how HTTP requests are processed and interpreted. It gave a small window into the vast amount of data traveling between hosts on the internet, even just in this very small server there were requests for things like the favicon which is interesting to see.
